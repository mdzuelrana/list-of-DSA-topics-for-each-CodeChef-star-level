Here's a concise list of key number theory topics and concepts commonly used in competitive programming (CP):

### Number Theory Topics for Competitive Programming:

1. Prime Numbers
2. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
3. Least Common Multiple (LCM)
4. Modular Arithmetic
5. Fermat's Little Theorem
6. Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
7. Sieve of Eratosthenes
8. Exponentiation by Squaring
9. Divisor Function
10. Euler's Totient Function (\( \phi(n) \))
11. Wilson's Theorem
12. Quadratic Residues
13. Extended Euclidean Algorithm
14. Modular Inverse
15. Fast Exponentiation
16. Count Primes (Sieve of Eratosthenes)
17. Primality Testing Algorithms (e.g., Miller-Rabin)
18. Chinese Remainder Theorem Implementation
19. Fast Multiplication Algorithms (e.g., Karatsuba, FFT)
20. Diophantine Equations

### Recommended Practice Areas:
- Problems related to prime factorization.
- GCD and LCM calculations.
- Modular arithmetic problems.
- Sieve-related problems for prime generation.
- Applications of number-theoretic functions in problems.

### Resources for Practice:
- **CodeChef**: Look for problems tagged with "Number Theory."
- **Codeforces**: Search for problems with "Mathematics" or "Number Theory" tags.

Focusing on these topics will strengthen your number theory knowledge and enhance your problem-solving skills in competitive programming.
